team den. muhehehe >:)

**This is a roblox exploit GUI made by den.**
*KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. SCRIPT IS IN ALPHA VERSION. PC ONLY SCRIPT*

# Den's GUI
Script Version: 0.1 <br><br>
So I decided to make an own GUI simillar to c00lkidd. I'm a c00lkidd fan (Pls no hate) so thats why i decided to make this, and this is still in development. I'll add more hacks in the future (probably, and i said probably cuz i would forget about it somehow.). I tried to make it old roblox themed but it turned out horrible.

## Features
- Client Hacks
- Server Hacks (W.I.P)
- Draggable GUI

## How to use
### Client-Sided Scripts
Fly - Click fly button to fly.<br>
WASD to move, Q,E/Space to move down and up. Click the button again to disable flying.


Noclip - Click noclip button to enable noclipping and click it again to disable noclipping. <br>
You won't fly, but you will go through walls. (excluding the thing you are standing on.)


Walkspeed - Enter a number in the textbox and click the *Walkspeed* button to change your walkspeed to the number you entered in the textbox.


TP User - Enter any player's username in the textbox and click *TP User* button to teleport you to your desired user.

### Server-Sided Scripts (These scripts are in development)
0 Gravity - Enables/Disables 0 Gravity


Kick - Enter any player's username in the textbox and click *Kick* button to kick them out of the game.


Ban - Enter any player's username in the textbox and click *Ban* button to ban them out of the game.
